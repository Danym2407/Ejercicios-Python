10 Things I Hate About You is one of my favourite movies, not just because of the PLOT, but because it has SO MANY dramatic scenes.
I love the poem and the way the main characters fall in love naturally, taking their time.
The fact that they were alike was pretty funny, ESPECIALLY SINCE  everyone was afraid of them because of their temperamentS. To the other students they SEEM rude and inmaturE,
but they where just BEING themselves.
I love how Heath Ledger (Patrick Verona) is so flirty; he haS the most beutiful smile. He is spicy and charming and I'm totally into him.

I would said that my favourite part of
        the movie is the concert but also the scene
        where Patrick dances through the soccer field
